1. (done) Create Simulation of four non-normal random samples
    - (d0ne) Exponential
    - (done)Weibull
    - (done) Uniform
    - (done, but we should change to be in terms of a and b instead of constant parameters) Inverse Triangle
        -I'm not super familiar with python, but it looks like we're arbitrarily placing b. It would be easier to define B as the halfway point, since that's how our math works out anyways


2. (done)use premade random number generator to simulate distributions

3. (I assumew done ) For the triangle do the following for random number generator
    -Compute PDF
    -Compute CDF
    -Solve for x by creating inverse CDF
    -Use random uniform numbers between 0 and 1 as input for inverse PDF

4. (done) Generate >50000 random data values for each distributions

5. (done) Make independent samples averages x_bar of size n = 5, 30, 100

6. (done) Make a 4x4 graphical table showing grid of histograms of original data in row 1, histograms of sample averages for n = 5, 30, 100 in row 2 3 & 4, 

7. (done) Assess normality of results for for each n = 100

8. Draw Conclusions
    - How was the simulation built
    - Show results of Simulation
    - How do results support CLT
    - What was learned about behaviour of sample means relative to original population of random variables
    - In what situations can CLT be appropriately applied?
    - Do we agree with rule of thumb that n should be > 30? If not, what rule of thumb do we use?
    - most significant Conclusion
    - Any other observations/conclusions?
    - How much did each team member contribute?
    

9. Make 5-10 minute presentation
